# About the Project

This is project for the course Applied Digital Image Processing. The idea behind it is to impplement and improve on current underwater image enhancement algorithms, which commonly include contrast enhancement and color correction. The following algorithms were implemented:

- [LAB Color Correction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275213614_A_New_Color_Correction_Method_for_Underwater_Imaging)

The front-end is created by [Habib Shahzad](https://github.com/Habib-Shahzad) and can be run locally following [this repository](https://github.com/Habib-Shahzad/adip-tool).

## Abstract

Underwater images are taken in an environment that has specific characteristics like low contrast and color distortion that make it difficult to capture clear images. Various image enhancement techniques can be used to improve the clarity, contrast, and color of these images, making them look closer to what the eye would see in person. In this paper, we introduce an efficient JavaScript-based tool to apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization and LAB color correction on the areas brushed by a user.
